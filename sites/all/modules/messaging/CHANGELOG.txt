// $Id: CHANGELOG.txt,v 1.1.2.10 2008/04/24 19:22:20 jareyero Exp $

TO DO
------
* Ability to receive the same message through more than one channel. It should be possible to implement some ‘abstract’ sending method that pipes messages through two or more other channels.
* Sending messages to potential users, with a reserved user id. It seems we are already good for that with latest hooks introduced in notifications module.
* Keeping a log of sent messages, facebook like. This could be mixed with adding some basic queueing into the messaging module.
* Simplify admin settings ui, get rid of configurable filtering for subjects which is not really needed, and implement some good text filtering for them that can anyway be overridden programatically.

  'destination', field for getting destination from user account.
  'subject_glue', to glue multipart message subjects, [Optional]
  'send_user', callback for sending to users [Optional]
