Chat Room allows users to talk together in real time. Users enter chat rooms
which can have multiple chats. Permissions can be set to restrict who can
access, edit, and create chats and chat rooms.

You can:

Create a chat room (at node/add/chatroom).
View a list of chat rooms (at chatrooms).
Add a title to the list of chat rooms (at admin/settings/chatroom).
Archive chats on the chat room edit page.

CHAT COMMANDS
-------------
/me - Send an italicized message preceded by *.

/msg username message - Send a private message to a specific user.

/away - Set your status to away.

/back - Return from away.

The following commands can be used by administrators while they are in a
chat:

/kick (username) - The user will be kicked from the chat and be redirected
to a message page (message is configurable). The other users in the chat
will just see that the user has left the chat. The kicked user can enter the
chat again.

/ban username - Permanently bans user from the chat. Works only for
registered users. Edit the chat room to remove users from the banned list.
